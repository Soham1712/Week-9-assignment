# Interactive Energy Flow Sankey Diagram Assignment

## Introduction:
This assignment focuses on creating an interactive Sankey diagram that visualizes energy flows, allowing for mouse-hover interactivity to highlight specific paths and linked nodes.

Students will learn how to implement D3.js for data visualization and interactivity related to energy flow representation.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset provided represents energy flow data from various sources to their respective endpoints.

## To Start the Assignment:
- Clone or download the provided folder.
- Open the `template` folder to find the starter code files.
- Follow the steps outlined below to modify the starter code into the completed assignment.
