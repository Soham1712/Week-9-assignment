# Interactive Energy Flow Sankey Diagram Assignment

## Introduction:
This assignment aims to create an interactive Sankey diagram illustrating energy flows with mouse-hover interactivity to emphasize specific paths and nodes. Students will leverage D3.js for data visualization, focusing on energy flow representation and interactivity.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset provided encompasses energy flow data from diverse sources to their respective endpoints.

## To Start the Assignment:
- Clone or download the provided folder.
- Open the `template` folder to find the starter code files.
- Follow the steps outlined below to modify the starter code into the completed assignment.

## Demo:

## Assignment Steps:
### Step 1: Setting Up the Basic Structure
- Open `index.html` in the `template` folder.
- Construct the necessary HTML structure and link the D3.js library.



### Step 2: Loading and Parsing the Dataset
- Refine the JavaScript file to load and parse the provided dataset.


### Step 3: Creating the Initial Sankey Diagram
- Develop the initial Sankey diagram based on the dataset structure.

### Step 4: Implementing Mouse-hover Interactivity
- Integrate event listeners to facilitate mouse-hover interactivity, highlighting paths and nodes.
- Implement the tooltip functionality to display information on flow and value upon hovering.

[Include code snippets or screenshots related to implementing tooltip functionality]

### Step 5: Finalizing and Testing
- Validate and test the interactive features to ensure smooth functionality.
