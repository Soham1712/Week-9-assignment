# Interactive Energy Flow Sankey Diagram Assignment

## Introduction:
This assignment aims to create an interactive Sankey diagram illustrating energy flows with mouse-hover interactivity to emphasize specific paths and nodes. Students will leverage D3.js for data visualization, focusing on energy flow representation and interactivity.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset provided encompasses energy flow data from diverse sources to their respective endpoints.

## To Start the Assignment:
- Clone or download the provided folder.
- Open the `template` folder to find the starter code files.
- Follow the steps outlined below to modify the starter code into the completed assignment.
